                    <h5>I can not find a player</h5>
                    <p>We only find out about players when they get searched for or via a friend already in our database.</p>

                    <h5>A player exists but does not have a rank</h5>
                    <p>Ranks are not live and get calculated at midnight (GMT), so new players may not have a rank right away.
                        <br/>We may not have access to your stats, you can allow access at by editing your profile on
                        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com">steamcommunity.com</a> and clicking "My Privacy Settings".</p>
